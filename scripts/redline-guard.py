"""Redline guard (pre-commit hook) — this repo's publication boundaries, enforced.

This repo is public and canonical (decisions/ADR-002): material is written
here first, so redaction happens at write time. "Redact carefully" is a
behavioral rule, and this repo's own incident series documents what those
are worth without a mechanical backstop. This is the backstop: every commit's
staged content is scanned for the ADR-001 boundary violations before it can
land.

What it blocks:
  1. Credential-shaped strings (GitHub token prefixes, Anthropic keys, AWS
     access key IDs, private-key blocks) — real, revoked, or "example".
  2. Private memory links ([[wiki-style]]) that leak the private notes layer.
  3. Local user paths (C:/Users/<name>, /c/Users/<name>) — publish ~-style
     paths instead.
  4. Identifying terms (the owner's username, employer names, private repo
     names). These ship as SHA-256 hashes, not literals — a guard that blocks
     private repo names can't have those names written in its own public
     source, or the guard file itself becomes the disclosure.
  5. Owner-slug repo references (sanlee-ys/<private-repo>) via the same
     hashed set.

Precision over reach: terms that are also common English words are flagged
only in repo-shaped contexts (within a few tokens of "repo"/"repository"/
"github"/"git" or in an owner slug), because a guard that fires on ordinary
prose gets routed around — the false-positive lesson from
security/credential-guard.py's history (see its docstring and
incidents/2026-07-03-credential-guard-interpreter-bypass.md).

Escape hatch: REDLINE_OK=1 <git commit ...> skips the guard for one commit,
for the rare legitimate case (e.g. documenting the guard itself). Using it
is a conscious act that should survive review.

Local extensions: an untracked .redlines.local file (one literal term per
line, gitignored) adds machine-local terms without publishing them.

Install:  git config core.hooksPath scripts/githooks
Verify:   stage a decoy violation and watch it block (see scripts/README.md).
