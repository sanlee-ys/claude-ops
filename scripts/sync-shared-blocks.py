"""Sync marker-delimited shared blocks across the fleet's CLAUDE.md files.

Some guidance (e.g. the link-verification hard rule) is identical across many
repos. Rather than copy-paste it — and let the copies drift — the canonical
text lives here in claude-ops (the operating-layer canon, ADR-002), and each
consumer repo carries a compressed restatement wrapped in marker comments:

    <!-- shared:links-verify v1 — canonical: <url> -->
    ...block...
    <!-- /shared:links-verify -->

This is the CLAUDE.md analogue of ``scripts/sync-claude-hooks``: it operates on
sibling clones (all repos checked out next to each other) and is the drift
tripwire for the shared blocks.

    python scripts/sync-shared-blocks.py --check   # report drift, exit 1 if any
    python scripts/sync-shared-blocks.py           # rewrite drifted blocks in place

Consumers are **discovered**, not enumerated: the script scans every sibling
``<repo>/CLAUDE.md`` under ``--root`` for shared-block markers, so this public
file names no repositories. ``--root`` defaults to the parent directory of this
repo. The first time a repo adopts a block, stamp the marker block in by hand
(replacing the old prose section); thereafter this script maintains it.
