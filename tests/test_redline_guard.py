"""Adversarial test suite for scripts/redline-guard.py.

The redline guard is the mechanical backstop that ADR-002 leans on: this repo
went public-first and canonical on the reasoning that redaction risk was
"addressed mechanically rather than avoided". Until this file existed, that
mechanism had **no behavioural tests** — CI only ran `py_compile` on it, which
proves the file parses and nothing else. A backstop that is itself only a
behavioural rule is the failure ADR-002 argued against, one level down.

These tests drive `scan()` directly, which is the pure part: given a path, a
blob of text and any local terms, return violations. The git plumbing around it
(`staged_files`, `staged_content`) is deliberately not tested here — it is a
thin `git` shell-out, and faking git buys less than it costs.

**No literal violation appears in this file.** Every fixture is assembled at
runtime from fragments, because a test file full of credential-shaped strings
and private memory links would be blocked by the very guard it tests. That
constraint is not an inconvenience; a guard you cannot write tests for without
disabling it would be a design smell, and building fixtures dynamically is the
demonstration that it fires on shape rather than on provenance.

Hashed terms (private repo names, identifying words) cannot be tested with
their real values — the whole point is that those plaintexts never appear in a
public repo. Instead the hashed sets are swapped for the hash of a known
innocuous word, which exercises the same code path with a value safe to publish.

Stdlib only, matching test_credential_guard.py, so CI stays a bare
`python -m unittest`.
