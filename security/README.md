# credential-guard

A `PreToolUse` hook for Claude Code that blocks common ways a credential ends
up printed in the clear to a session transcript. It's a mechanical backstop,
not a policy document: the behavioral rule ("never print a credential-shaped
value unmasked") already failed twice before this existed. See
[`../posture.md`](../posture.md) for the reasoning behind treating this as a
hook rather than a habit, [`../incidents/`](../incidents/) for the specific
leaks that shaped it, and [`../decisions/ADR-003-delegation-maturity.md`](../decisions/ADR-003-delegation-maturity.md)
for the v1→v2 rewrite decision.

## v2: path-based default-deny

`hook-version: 2`. v1 was a **command-shape denylist** — it enumerated the read
verbs it knew about (`cat`, `Get-Content`, `open()`, a short list) and blocked
those. Every one of the four 2026-07 credential incidents was a shape v1's
author hadn't enumerated yet, so the guard trailed each leak by exactly one
incident. An enumerated denylist cannot win that race; it only ever lists the
last leak's shape.

v2 inverts the default. Instead of "is this one of the readers I listed?", the
question is "**does a sensitive target's content reach the caller, unless this
is a recognised _safe_ operation?**" A pager or formatter nobody thought to
list (`head`, `xxd`, `base64`, `jq`, `awk`), an interpreter one-liner, or a
content-returning tool that isn't hooked yet is denied **by default**; the
small set of things that legitimately name a credential path without reading it
(a `git commit` message, `ls`, `stat`, `rm`, `grep -l`, heredoc prose) is
allowed.

## What it hooks

- **Bash / PowerShell** — the `command` string, split into segments and checked
  for environment dumps, credential-shaped variable prints, `claude mcp get`,
  and sensitive-path reads (default-deny by the segment's leading command).
- **Grep** — blocked only when `output_mode` is `content` and the `path` (or a
  `glob`) targets a credential file. `files_with_matches` and `count` never
  echo the matched line, so they stay allowed — they're the recommended
  existence check.
- **Glob** — allowed. It returns paths, not content, so it can confirm a file
  exists (the safe fallback the guard itself recommends) but can't print a
  secret's value.
- **Every other tool** — blocked if *any* path-bearing field (`file_path`,
  `path`, `notebook_path`, `uri`, …) targets a credential file. This is the key
  v2 change: coverage is keyed on the field, not a hard-coded `{Read, Grep}`
  pair, so `Read`, notebook reads, and an MCP file-reader tool that doesn't
  exist yet are all covered by construction. It's the structural fix for the
  2026-07-04 tool-shape gap (`incidents/2026-07-04-github-pat-read-grep-leak.md`),
  which was "the hook only named Bash/PowerShell" one tool-generation earlier.

Because coverage is now field-based, wire the hook to match **as many tools as
your `settings.json` allows** (ideally all of them), not just the four v1
named — a tool the matcher doesn't route to is a tool the guard never sees.

## What it blocks

1. **Environment dumps** — `env`, `printenv`, bare `set`, `export -p`,
   `declare -p`, and the PowerShell `Env:` / `Variable:` dumps, including the
   dump-then-filter form (`env | grep -i token`) that v1's end-anchored pattern
   missed.
2. **Targeted credential-variable prints** — `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
   `printenv GITHUB_TOKEN`, `[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("...KEY")`.
   This is the exact shape of the 2026-07-02 *founding* incident, which v1
   never caught.
3. **Reads of a credential store's content, by any means** — `cat`/`head`/
   `tail`/`xxd`/`base64`/`strings`/`jq`/`awk`/…, interpreter one-liners
   (`python -c open().read()`, `node`, `perl`, PowerShell `[IO.File]::…`),
   `< file` redirection into a reader, the `Read` tool, content-mode `Grep`, or
   any other tool's path field. Anything whose leading command isn't on the
   safe allowlist and that names a sensitive path is denied.
4. **`claude mcp get <name>`** — prints a registered server's stored env vars
   (secrets) by design. Use `claude mcp list` to check status without values.

The sensitive-path set covers the Claude config tree (`.claude/settings.json`,
`.claude.json`), `.env*` and `.envrc`, `credentials*.json` and token caches,
SSH and other private keys (`id_rsa`/`id_ed25519`/`id_ecdsa`/`*.pem`/`*.key`/
`*.p12`/…), cloud CLIs (`~/.aws`, `~/.azure`, gcloud), package/registry stores
(`.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.netrc`, `.docker/config.json`), infra
(`.kube/config`, `.pgpass`, `*.tfstate`), `.git-credentials`, the GitHub CLI
`hosts.yml`, shell history, and `/proc/*/environ`. Non-secret dotenv templates
(`.env.example`, `.env.sample`, …) are explicitly allowed.

### What it deliberately does *not* block

The threat model is **non-adversarial agent mistakes**, not a determined local
attacker — anyone with local code execution has already won (see `posture.md`).
So a handful of shapes are left to the permission allowlist (no `$(...)`, no
arbitrary shell control-flow) and to Layer 4 (rotate any credential that
touches a transcript), not to this hook: copy-then-read laundering (`cp secret
x; cat x`), indirection through a script the guard can't see into (`bash
leak.sh`), wildcard/variable-assembled path names (`cat ~/.claud*.json`), and
`MASK-OK` forgery. These are asserted as *allowed* in the test suite so the
boundary is explicit — a well-meaning future change that blocks them (and
starts causing false positives) fails a test on purpose.

## The MASK-OK escape hatch

A full unmasked read is sometimes genuinely necessary — a deliberate secret
audit. Add `MASK-OK` anywhere in a Bash or PowerShell command to skip all
checks for that command. There's no equivalent for Read/Grep/other tools, since
they carry no free-text command — fall back to Bash/PowerShell with `MASK-OK`.

Exit code 0 allows the tool call; exit code 2 blocks it and surfaces the
message on stderr to the model. The hook fails **open** (exits 0) on an
unparseable payload — a conscious availability-over-strictness choice for a
guard whose threat model is honest mistakes, so a malformed payload never
wedges the tool.

## Tests: the adversarial suite (and CI)

[`../tests/test_credential_guard.py`](../tests/test_credential_guard.py) is the
mechanical version of the decoy smoke test below: one case (or more) per bypass
shape in the ADR-003 taxonomy, plus the false-positive/allow cases that keep
the guard usable. It drives the guard exactly as the harness does — a
PreToolUse JSON payload on stdin, asserting exit 0/2 — using stdlib `unittest`
only, so there's nothing to install. No real secret values appear in it; the
guard keys on paths and command shapes, so the fixtures reference sensitive
*paths* and fake variable *names*, never a token.

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

CI ([`../.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs it on
every push and PR. The point (ADR-003 Phase 1): the next bypass is caught by a
red build, not by a fifth postmortem.

## Canonical source and the sync obligation

Per [`../decisions/ADR-002-public-first-canonicality.md`](../decisions/ADR-002-public-first-canonicality.md),
**this file is canonical**; the live deploy at `~/.claude/hooks/` and any
machine-provisioning copies sync *from* here. The `hook-version` header is the
drift tripwire — bumping it (as this rewrite did, 1 → 2) means every copy is now
stale until re-synced. A guard that's been rewritten in the repo but not
redeployed to a machine is not protecting that machine: "I wrote the guard" and
"the guard is active here" are two separate facts that each have to be checked
(the deployment-≠-authorship lesson from the uncapped-fanout postmortem).

## Wiring it into settings.json

The hook is a single script invoked once per matching tool call via
stdin/stdout, the standard shape for a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook. In
`settings.json`, add matcher entries under `hooks.PreToolUse` pointing each
matched tool's `command` at this script (e.g. `python3 /path/to/
credential-guard.py`). Match as broad a set of tools as the schema allows —
with v2's field-based coverage, every unmatched tool is a blind spot. Consult
Claude Code's own hooks documentation for the exact matcher/command JSON shape,
since that schema is versioned by the harness, not by this repo.

## Verifying the live install: the decoy-file smoke test

The automated suite proves the guard's *logic* against the repo copy. It does
**not** prove the guard is installed and active on *this machine* — that's the
separate fact above. Verify the live deploy with a decoy:

1. Create a harmless decoy with a shape the pattern matches, e.g.
   `credentials-test.json` containing a fake, obviously-not-real value.
2. Try to read it through each covered path: `cat`/`head`/`Get-Content` in
   Bash/PowerShell, a Read tool call, a content-mode Grep, and a non-`cat`
   reader like `base64`. Each should be blocked with the guard's message.
3. Confirm `files_with_matches`/`count`-mode Grep and a metadata check
   (`stat`/`Test-Path`) against the same file still succeed.
4. Try a Bash/PowerShell read with `MASK-OK` and confirm it goes through.
5. Delete the decoy file.

A hook that looks right on inspection but hasn't been exercised against a real
blocked case and a real allowed case — on the machine that's supposed to be
protected — isn't verified yet.
