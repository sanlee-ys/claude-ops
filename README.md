# claude-ops

Field notes on running an agentic coding CLI as a real teammate on a real
machine, with real credentials sitting nearby — written by one engineer,
for one machine, published because the failure modes don't stay put.

## Why this exists

Agentic CLIs like Claude Code don't just edit files anymore. They run shell
commands, read arbitrary config, call MCP servers with live tokens in their
environment, and fan out into multi-agent workflows that can spend real money
in minutes. That combination — broad tool access plus standing credentials —
is a live security surface, and it's under-documented. Most of what's written
about it is either marketing ("agents are safe by design") or after-the-fact
incident response at a company that isn't going to publish its postmortems.

This repo is neither. It's the operating layer that grew out of actually
running Claude Code day to day on one machine: a security posture, a
`PreToolUse` hook that enforces part of it mechanically, six incident
postmortems written in blameless format with the failures left in, five
reusable skills, and the working agreements (how work gets scoped, how
parallel sessions stay out of each other's way) that the posture and the
incidents both assume.

Three of the six postmortems are credential exposures — one of them covering
two separate leaks of the same GitHub PAT — for four exposure events in one
week, three of them the *same* credential leaking through a *different* tool
or command shape each time, because the guard that closed the previous gap
was scoped to the surface someone had thought to enumerate, not to the
surface that actually existed. That pattern — a mechanical control that's
only as complete as its author's imagination — is the throughline of this
repo, and it's also the reason the guard's own source is published here
rather than kept private. Security through "attacker doesn't know the rules"
doesn't hold on a machine where the attacker already has local execution;
the guard's value is defense-in-depth, not secrecy, so publishing it costs
nothing and might get the next gap found by a reader instead of a leak.

## Map

- **`operating-model.md`** — the working agreements this all runs on: DCB
  (Direction / Contracts / Bar) as the scoping discipline for ambiguous work,
  a session pre-flight checklist (sync before touching anything, one concern
  per branch), and the protocol for running several sessions in parallel
  across machines that only share a git remote.
- **`security/`**
  - `posture.md` — the layered security model: permission allowlist design,
    escape hatches, and the standing rule that credential-touching commands
    (token rotation, key generation) are run by the human directly, never
    through a tool call.
  - `credential-guard.py` — the published `PreToolUse` hook. Blocks bulk
    environment dumps and reads of known-sensitive files (shell config,
    SSH keys, cloud CLI credential stores, `.env` files) across Bash,
    PowerShell, Read, and content-mode Grep. What it covers is also, by
    omission, a map of what it doesn't — that's discussed openly in
    `security/README.md` and in the incidents.
  - `README.md` — how the hook is wired in, what it does and doesn't cover,
    and the override convention for legitimate reads it blocks.
- **`incidents/`** — six blameless postmortems, each with a 5-whys and a
  fixes-applied table:
  - `2026-07-02-plaintext-api-key-exposure.md`
  - `2026-07-02-uncapped-premium-fanout.md`
  - `2026-07-03-github-pat-plaintext-recurrence.md`
  - `2026-07-03-credential-guard-interpreter-bypass.md`
  - `2026-07-04-github-pat-read-grep-leak.md`
  - `2026-07-04-graphify-console-flash-three-surfaces.md`
- **`skills/`** — five custom skills (`dcb`, `descope-sweep`, `park`,
  `proglog`, `handoff`) published as patterns, with a `README.md` explaining
  what each does and when it fires.
- **`decisions/ADR-001-public-claude-ops-repo.md`** — the scope contract for
  this repo: what gets published, what never does, and why the private
  originals stay canonical while this is a curated, manually-synced copy.

## Start here

1. **`security/posture.md`** — the model this repo assumes: layered
   controls, not a single silver-bullet hook.
2. **`incidents/2026-07-04-github-pat-read-grep-leak.md`** — the sharpest
   illustration of the throughline above. A hook built to stop shell
   commands from leaking a token got bypassed by Claude's own `Read` and
   `Grep` tools reading the same file with no shell involved — and even
   "grep instead of cat" wasn't safe, because content-mode grep still prints
   the matched line, and the matched line for a `"KEY": "value"` config
   entry *is* the secret.
3. **`security/credential-guard.py`** — the fix, in the form it actually
   runs in.

## Scale, honestly

This is one engineer's machine, not a team or a platform. There's no fleet,
no shared incident channel, no on-call rotation — every "postmortem" here is
a solo session catching its own mistake in the same turn it happened. It's
published anyway because the failure modes (tool-shape gaps in a mechanical
guard, uncapped multi-agent fan-out cost, a debugging session in production
credentials by accident) don't depend on team size. They just need an agent
with shell access and a person who trusts it a little too soon.
