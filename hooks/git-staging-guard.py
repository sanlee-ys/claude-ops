"""Git staging guard (global PreToolUse hook) — no whole-tree staging.

WHY. San runs several Claude sessions at once across sibling repos and two
machines. A repo's working tree routinely holds uncommitted work that the
current session did not create and cannot see the purpose of. ``git add -A`` /
``-u`` / ``.`` and ``git commit -a`` stage *whatever is dirty*, not *what I
changed*, so they silently sweep another session's in-flight work into an
unrelated commit.

This happened twice on 2026-07-18/19:

  - ``git add -A`` committed a nested repository's gitlink that the session had
    never touched (fixed with ``git rm --cached`` in a follow-up).
  - ``git add -u`` swept six files of another session's in-flight work — one of
    them a couple of thousand lines — into a one-line docs commit, which then
    went to the default branch. Left in place with a ``git notes`` scope
    correction rather than rewriting a branch other machines may have pulled.

Neither was destructive. Both were avoidable. The second happened *after* the
first was already a known lesson in the same session, which is the actual
finding: this is a reflex, and a behavioural rule has now failed twice. The
durable fix for a reflex is a mechanism, not an intention.

WHAT IS BLOCKED. Only whole-tree staging:

    git add -A | --all | -u | --update | .
    git commit -a | --all | -am (any combined short flag containing 'a')

WHAT IS NOT. Explicit paths — ``git add src/api.py tests/test_api.py`` — which
is the correct habit this leaves as the path of least resistance. Also fine:
``git commit -m``, ``git add -p``, ``git -C <repo> add <path>``, and every
other git subcommand.

FALSE-POSITIVE DISCIPLINE. The credential guard's v1 blocked its own commit
message for quoting an example, and that lesson is inherited here — this hook
was written on a day whose commit messages repeatedly quote ``git add -u`` as
the thing that went wrong. So:

  - heredoc BODIES are stripped before scanning (commit messages live there);
  - a flag only counts in an actual command position, after a leading ``git``;
  - quoted strings are not command positions, so ``-m "used git add -A"`` and
    ``echo 'git add -A'`` both pass.

OVERRIDE. Prefix the command with ``STAGE-ALL-OK`` when whole-tree staging is
genuinely correct — a fresh repo's first commit, or a tree you have just
verified is exclusively yours. It is deliberately a per-command opt-in, not a
setting: the point is that the decision gets made rather than defaulted.

MESSAGE = """GIT STAGING GUARD: `{offence}` stages whatever is dirty, not what you changed.

Parallel Claude sessions leave uncommitted work in these trees that this session

work into an unrelated commit - the second time onto the default branch, after
the first was already a known lesson in the same session.

Do this instead:

    git -C <repo> add path/one path/two       # name the files you changed
    git -C <repo> show --stat HEAD            # confirm the commit's scope

If whole-tree staging really is correct here (a fresh repo's first commit, or a
tree you have just verified is exclusively yours), prefix the command with
{override} - a per-command decision, on purpose.
